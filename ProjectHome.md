### Benefits ###
  * Portability for your email messages
  * Forensic analysis of iOS emails

## How it works ##
Apple iOS products store e-mails as a SQLLite database. This application can read these, and export them to a simple spreadsheet (CSV) format. This format can then be imported to applications such as Outlook.

## Notes on using with an iPhone ##
  * Had to jailbreak phone, then use iDevice Manager to pull email database from /var/mobile/Library/Mail/
  * Didn’t work on XP
  * Copied to Windows 7, then had to install .Net Framework 4 for it to work
  * Help file says Select the “Protected Envelope” file and click convert, should say click “Read iOS email files”
  * (Thanks to Tim Riley for this)
